Certification
=============

Certification is an optional process to ensure trans ppl aren't being harmed by
IRC network and channel staff.

Certified networks and channels are guaranteed not to ban trans ppl for saying
stuff like this:

> on this Transgender Day Of Violence #TDOV get web browsers to permanently
> transition.
> 
> make it so bigots can't avoid us. we're coming for them.
>
> we do honestly believe software vendors should be legally obligated to
> acknowledge the communities that have contributed to the software.
> 
> web browsers should absolutely pop up an "this software was made possible
> with contributions from the trans, furry, autistic communities".

IRC channels may only be certified if the IRC network they belong to is also
certified, as there's no point in having a certified channel if network staff
would just ban everyone in it.
