## On Visible Gender Diversity Itself

The plan for visible gender diversity is to prefix one's realname with genders. For example:

- "Genders: ♾️, 🟪⬜🟩; Soni L." - For Soni, these represent autgender and genderqueer respectively.

The use of emoji makes it stand out, which is an explicit part of "*visible* gender diversity", but there's nothing special about the syntax/formatting. Additionally, not having a real mechanism for it means it can't easily be blocked/filtered/pretended it's not there, which is important for visibility and as such also for diversity.

On that note, IRC client developers are encouraged to omit the wording "realname" when displaying others' realnames. For example, this is an acceptable way to display it in a /whois:

- Soni (Genders: ♾️, 🟪⬜🟩; Soni L.)

But this is an unacceptable way to display it:

- Soni (realname: Genders: ♾️, 🟪⬜🟩; Soni L.)
