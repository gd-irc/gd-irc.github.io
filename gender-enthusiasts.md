## On Supporting Gender Diversity

It's important for channel and network operators to make sure those who want to 
participate in visible gender diversity on IRC are kept safe. This includes,
but is not limited to, having rules and policies against mocking gender tags.
It's also important not to push the gender tags on users: users may not be out
everywhere and, by design, gender tags aren't channel-specific. Nevertheless,
channel and network operators can - and should - do a lot to make *more* users
feel safe to use gender tags.
