## Gender Diversity on IRC

GD-IRC is a project/community for promoting and supporting gender diversity on IRC.

## Code of Conduct

Instead of having a strict code of conduct, we have opted to go with examples
of Encouraged, Discouraged and Unacceptable behaviours. Additionally, this list
is intended to change and be added to over time.

### Encouraged Behaviours

- If you believe an issue needs to be formally addressed as it could have a
    direct impact on GD-IRC operations, reach out to us.
- There is no one way to define, communicate, or enforce boundaries. Be
    understanding of different ways to formulate and communicate boundaries and
    do not insist on everyone using the same coherent language.

### Discouraged Behaviours

### Unacceptable Behaviours

- Blocking someone and continuing to engage with them, especially after they
    already stopped engaging with you and have requested that you do the same.
    - We do not care if they have a past, they already stopped interacting with
        you.

## Plans

The current plans are:

- [On Visible Gender Diversity Itself](./gender-spec.md)
- [On Supporting Gender Diversity](./gender-enthusiasts.md)
- [Renaming "Realname" to "Userdata"](./userdata-spec.md)
